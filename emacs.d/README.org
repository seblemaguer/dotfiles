This is my emacs configuration file. It is under version control and available, among other
configurations, at this repository: https://github.com/seblemaguer/dotfiles

* Command line management
This part is dedicated to support some configuration using the command line by defining some options.
For now, only the option =--no-connection= is defined in order enforce the loading without packages requiring internet.

* DONE Definition of no-web helper routines
CLOSED: [2023-07-19 Wed 20:41]

I found the strategy of defining tables to store keybindings proposed by [[https://config.phundrak.com/][phundrak]] pretty interesting.
It has two main advantages.
First, it allows to ensure a better consistency.
Second, it provides a neatty way to generate a refcard of my personal bindings.

I also extending this to support not only default keybindings but also hydra.
As a result, we have now three routines:
  - keybindings-gen :: generate the elisp for the keybindings from a given table
  - hydra-keybindings-gen :: generate the elisp for the *hydra* keybindings from a given table
  - hydra-keybindings-gen-with-opt :: same as previously but dedicated to take into account options specificied for hydra

** DONE Package management [100%]
My configuration relies on a lot (too-many?) of packages.
It relies primarly on =use-package= and some extensions.
The process of how to deal with the packages is the following:
  - by default, if possible, let's use =melpa=
  - if the package is not on melpa, let's use =straight=
  - if the package is on melpa but requires extra development, let's use =straight=

Furthermore, each package is tagged with several keywors to have a "machine-dependent" loading scheme.

*** DONE Tagging

I am using keywords/tags to define a loading scheme for each of the machine where emacs is installed.
Each package, from now on, has one or multiple keywords associated using the key =:tags=.
Each computer has a series of tags which are required to be loaded.
The specification respects the following syntax:
  - list of strings which are
  - a tag prefixed by =!= explicitely reject packages whose have this tag associated with
  - ="ALL"= is a joker indicating =all the tags!= $\rightarrow$ no filtering

I use hydra a lot so it is easier to add its support directly in the use-package configuration part.
The combination pretty-hydra/major-mode-hydra provides an easy and powerful way to declare hydra.
While alternatives exist, I find this combination more straightforward and cleaner when it is used in combination with =use-package=.

** DONE Notifications [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:14]
Emacs is my entry point for almost everything.
Therefore, it is also useful to have the notifications handled directly in Emacs.
To do so, I rely on the couple sauron/alert.
Alert is the entry point for raising notifications while sauron is used to log the notifications.

This combination allows me to use the modeline as an indicator of the priority of the notification.
By doing so, I can be aware of a notification but choose to ignore it if I am focusing on something else.
If another notification of at most the same priority is raised, it will be logged but there won't be any visible cue.
However, if a notification of an higher priority is raised, the color of the modeline will be updated to reflect the priority of the notification.

*** DONE Sauron
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:13]
Sauron is the pivot of the notification system.
However, I need to use my own fork for two reasons:

Then, it defines the fundamentals of the GTD pipeline by adding some TODO keywords:
  - =CANCELLED= for the task which is not necessary after a bit of thinking;
  - =BLOCKED= for tasks which are blocked by an external event;
  - =HOLD= for tasks which are manually put to sleep for whatever reason;
  - =RUNNING= for tasks which are running but doesn't requires any manual operation (i.e. process on the cluster)
  - =DELEGATED= for tasks which are delegated to someone else
  - =REMINDER= for long "tasks" (e.g., cancelling info, ...) or tasks which have been completed but requires the reception of an element (e.g., orders, ...x)

** DONE Source [100%]
The source visualisation of org files can be pretty raw.
This section provides configurations to help the navigation and the visualisation of such files.

*** DONE Pretty bullets and better navigation
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 12:55]
The key problem in my opinion is how are visualize the headings.
=org-superstar= provides a clearer indentation and visualisation of such headings.
This is fundamental to have an easy navigation in such files which can be really large (see the current one!).
=org-bulletproof= provides a more convenient way to switch between ordered and unordered list.
Combined with =org-superstar=, this leads to the ultimate org-mode list management

It relies on three packages:
=org-roam= which is the core of the workflow,

=vulpea= is used to bridge =org-roam= and =org-agenda=.

=org-ref= to bridge =org-mode= and the bibtex,
=citar= to enhance the experience orf =org-cite=,
and =org-roam-bibtex= to connect this managemente with =org-roam=.

  - =helm= is provided for some specific completion tools which are interesting but are not supported by =completing-read=

CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:52]
Consult provides a set of commands which are particularly useful.
It is a nice extension to =Vertico= which brings to functionalities close to the ones proposed in =swiper= and =counsel=.

** DONE Templating [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:58]
I use templates for two cases:
  - starting point as new script/code file
  - accessing to some snippets.

In both cases, I rely on =yasnippet=.

*** DONE Snippets
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:57]
The default configuration of yasnippet consists of activating it and plugging it with company.
Obviously, the package =yasnippet-snippets= is also configured to provide default snippets.
I also use the package =consult-yasnipet= to list the snippets.
Finally, my own snippets are stored in the directory =~/.emacs.d/third_parties/snippets=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** DONE File templates
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:58]

** DONE Action triggering
CLOSED: [2021-05-27 Thu 18:34]
=embark= provides ways to execute an action to an ~emacs object~ (an URL, a region, ....).
It is a convenient package to have a more refined control of my workflow.

I configured the configuration around two main parts:
refining the default compilation support and add fly-checking support.

*** DONE Baseline compilation

I just modify a little bit the default compilation to be a little more "user friendly".
I also rely on =fancy-compilation= to enhance the the output in the compilation buffer.

*** DONE Flychecking
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 18:13]
For the fly checking, I use flycheck instead of flymake.
The key part of this configuration is the fact that checking the documentation is disabled.
I also use =flycheck-posframe= to have a quick idea of what is going on at the pointed error/warning/...

** DONE Commenting
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 18:33]
For the commenting, the common denominator is how to deal with FIXMEs.
To do so, I relie on two part: =hl-todo= for the highlighting and occur for the listing.
For language specific configurations, it is done in the language configuration part.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package hl-todo

** DONE Formatting

In order to format the buffer, it is better to rely on external formatter/linter.
=format-all= proposes support of big bunch of them, so I am using it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

To do so, I rely mainly on Language Server Protocol (LSP) and for the debugging I relay on the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).

** DONE Tree sitter general configuration

Tree-sitter is neat way of dealing with syntax highlighting.

YAML is my main configuration format file as it supports references and more importantly comments.
I mainly rely on =yaml-mode= to which I add outline support for a better navigation.

*** DONE VIM
CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 06:55]
I am using VIM as an alternative editor for quick editions, so I need to be able to modify its configuration.
To do so, I actually use Emacs and rely on =vimrc-mode=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** DONE GIT
CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 06:58]
I am using GIT as my main VC.
GIT relies on, at least, three types of configuration files: the general ~config~ , the ~gitignore~ and the ~attributes~ files.
I use a dedicated mode for each type.

CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 07:03]
CRON is a useful tool to plan some executions.
However the default editor is too raw for me.

** DONE Logging
CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 07:07]
In all of my scripts/software, I rely more on loggers than print.
Therefore, visualizing logs is key and =log-view= is a really flexible mode for this.
While it is configured to open files whose basenames contain ~syslog~ or the extension is composed by ~.log~.
In both cases, backup numbers are as well supported.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

* DONE Writing / Reading [100%]
I decided to dissociate programming and writing for more clarity.
Nonetheless, both sections rely on the same principles.
Concerning the writing part, I use mainly org-mode and LaTeX (article and shared documents).
I also use markdown for README and collaborative projects.
Finally, concerning the reading part, I consider only PDF Files.
I use libreoffice/office 365 for official documents which can't be handled in PDF.

** DONE LaTeX [100%]
LaTeX is the core languages I am using to write scientific documents and presentations.
My configuration relies mainly on auctex but I had to tweak several part to match my way of dealing with such files.
These tweaks concerns mainly of using =outline= to deal with folding,
using the ~enquote~ command to do some quotation in latex and prepare a proper pdf compilation/synchronization.

My code project management is articulated around three key points: GIT, github/gist and =projectile=.
GIT is used as the version control manager;
github for the non-sensitive repositories;
gist for snippets and helpers;
=projectile= to provide project helpers.

** DONE Git

My configuration for GIT relies mainly on =magit=.
Aside the standard key/hydra configuration,
I copied the external opening from https://gist.github.com/dotemacs/9a0433341e75e01461c9
and the pretty configuration is adapted from https://ekaschalk.github.io/post/pretty-magit/

My whole process relies on the commits following this pattern
#+begin_example
[package] operation: short message

optional further description
#+end_example

where:
 - package :: corresponds to subpart of the repository (so mainly packages, modules, or meta and git related informations).
 - operation :: is ~add~, ~update~, ~fix~, ~clean~ or ~doc~
 - short message :: is a short description
 - optional further description :: is used to complete the short description. It is optional and I don't use it so often; only for complicated tweaks

* Shell [100%]
Sometimes I need to start a terminal inside Emacs (not only for geekery-purposes).
To do so, I rely now on =vterm= coupled with zsh.

* DONE File manager [100%]
I am using emacs as my main file manager.
To do so, I rely on =dired= which is builtin package which I tweaked massively and I added multiple subpackages to improve UX.
I also added support for basic image processing and some additional operations (trashing, visualising diffs, ...).

** DONE Dired/Dirvish [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 18:55]
The configuration of =dired= focuses mainly on defining keys, tuning the files to omit, and tweaking the LS command used to get the informations.
The hydra mapping is adapted from https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/wiki/Dired.
I also replace a base deletion by moving the files/directories to the trash.

Emacs is my only email client.

*** DONE Composing emails
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 08:27]
To compose emails, I rely on the combination of multiple packages.
Obviously, the entry point is the package =message= whose ~message-mode~ is the major mode used to edit new emails.
I configured the package to support some additional features like a proper signature and a proper formatting.
I also updated the citation line/format.

As I am using multiple account, I use the package =smtpmail-multi= to sort this out.
The default account is my TCD email as it is my daily use email.

Because, sometimes, I want to send rich emails, I use =org-msg= which relies on the HTML exporter provided by =org= to generate HTML emails.
Finally, as I am quite absent-minded, I use a reminder to not forget the attachment: =message-attachment-reminder=.

*** DONE Mu4e [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 08:53]
As I previously indicated, =mu4e= is my entry point to deal with emails.
However, it can't be installed via melpa.
I have a bunch of scripts which are configuring my linux environment on ~~/environment/~.
These scripts are installing ~mu~ and =mu4e= so the first thing to do here is to point the current configuration ~load-path~.

The core of the configuration is separated in four main parts:
the hydra definition, the adaptation of the ~mu4e~ environment, the introduction of new primitives and, finally, the definition of contexts.
The last part is the most important as it provides the configuration for the mail accounts.
These configurations are set in the private configuration file and provided by the function =set-mu4e-contexts=.
I also redesigned the header buffer.

** DONE Chat [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:32]
As for the email, I (try to) use emacs as my chatting entry point as well.
To do so, I rely on three key tools: the couple bitlbee/IRC for facebook messenger, skype, ...; slack and matrix.
I added a bunch of helpers to start/stop all the accounts in one shot.

*** DONE IRC
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:32]
The IRC configuration is quite standard.
I added a couple of primitives to access more easily the passwords (~my-irc-password~) and to format properly the chat buffer (~erc-format-buffer~).
I slightly tweaked the formatting to be more tolerant and added a bunch of plugins to enhance the UX.
Finally, the account definition is done in the private configuration file (so it is not shown here!).

CLOSED: [2021-12-10 Fri 12:19]
I am playing music in Emacs using EMMS.
The default configuration is already satisfying but I prefered to tweak a couple of part to make it more useable.
The first thing I changed is to use ~mpv~ as a player as I am already it as a default on my system.
I also tweaked the cache and some rendering part as I have a lot of files to navigate through.
Finally, I activated the browser and assigned the multimedia keys to be understood directly by EMMS.

As Emacs is the entry point of my numerical life, I connected to a bunch of other external things.
It can be summarized around three categories:
the connection to the desktop environment,
the connection to the local operating system,
and the connection to servers (mainly computing clusters).

Emacs Application Framework (EAF) provides a way to integrate multiple applications internally into Emacs.

In this section, I configure packages to access system informations and enforce the shell environment into Emacs.

*** DONE Tools
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:21]
This section is dedicated to the configuration of specific tools.
For now, it comprises ~Docker~ and ~Conda~.

**** DONE Docker
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:20]

I am using micromamba (more efficient than conda) to configure different environment for ~Python~ and ~R~.
While =conda.el= provide a nice environment management, it is not compatible with micromamba.
However =SqrtMinusOne= developped the package =micromamba.el= which provides a nice support for this tools.

*** DONE Dealing with processes
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:26]
To deal with background processes, I rely on two packages: =prodigy= and =elcontext=.
=prodigy= is used to run and monitor the processes.
However, =prodigy= doesn't provide a nice way to start processes automatically.
=elcontext= is used to deal with the start.
Yet =elcontext= is still slightly bugged, so I use my own fork right now.
Currently, it is mainly used to start/stop emails but it is likely to be expanded in the future.

** DONE Emacs and the servers
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:06]
Finally, I access to computing clusters regularly.
The main tools I am using there are ~docker~ and ~slurm~.
As an entry point, as every Emacs use, I use =tramp= to deal with servers using SSH as a backend.
=slurm-mode= doesn't rely on =tramp= and does not proposes remote access by default.
However, a hack was proposed in [[https://github.com/truls/slurm.el/tree/explicit-username][truls]] fork
I prefere to use my own fork as I would like to expand a bit more the rendering.

*** DONE Anki editor
CLOSED: [2023-09-18 Mon 16:47]
[[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][Anki]] is flash-card program.
=anki-editor= is a mode which interfaces =org-mode= and Anki.
This provides a really neat way to create Anki cards easily directly in emacs.

Before anything, it is necessary to install Anki and [[https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/][Anki-Connect]].
To install Anki, just follow the instruction on the application webpage: https://apps.ankiweb.net/
To install Anki-Connect:
 1. Open the =Install Add-on= dialog by selecting =Tools | Add-ons | Get Add-ons...= in Anki.
 2. Input =2055492159= into the text box labeled =Code= and press the OK button to proceed.
 3. Restart Anki when prompted to do so in order to complete the installation of Anki-Connect.

* DONE Visual [100%]
For the visual part, I rely mainly on =nano-emacs= developed by Nicolas P. Rougier.
It is a simple layout but incredibly clear and precise.
I deviate from it by prefering my emacs (color) theme (=flatfluc-theme=) and I tweaked a bit the layout (see =nano-layout=).
Concerning the layout, I needed to add a specific font resolution for my surface.
This is done in the ~config~ part of the package loading.
I also need =rainbow-mode= to help visualize the colors when editing the themes.

** DONE Helpers [100%]
In order to guide me a little bit more to the information I need,
I introduce a couple of visual helpers.
All of these helpers are configured in this section.

*** DONE Segmenting
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:51]
To segment properly different part of the code, I rely on two key concepts: separators and page breaks
Separators are coming in two ways: unary (like space) and binary (parenthesis style).
For the former, I sometimes activate the builtin =whitespace-mode= but it doesn't require any configuration.
For the latter, I rely on =smartparens= for the editing part and =rainbow-delimiters= to associate a color to each level of parenthesis.
It is to be noted than =smartparens= is much more completing than what I described and I may use some functionalities without knowing it.
Finally, the package =page-break-lines= provides a nice way to visualize a page break (^L) to be easily spotted.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Use puni-mode globally and disable it for term-mode.
  (use-package puni
    :defer t
    :init
    ;; The autoloads of Puni are set up so you can enable `puni-mode` or
    ;; `puni-global-mode` before `puni` is actually loaded. Only after you press
    ;; any key that calls Puni commands, it's loaded.
    (puni-global-mode)
    (add-hook 'term-mode-hook #'puni-disable-puni-mode))

  (use-package rainbow-delimiters
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :hook
    (prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode))

  (use-package page-break-lines
    :tags '("VISUAL")

    (global-page-break-lines-mode t))

*** DONE Navigating
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:46]
Modifying/Navigating can lead to be slightly confused what has just happened.
I added =googles= to briefly flash to indicate what just changed and =scrollkeeper= to see where I am after a massive scrolling operation.
I also add =xhair= to visualize where I am (line + column) when I need to align things column-wise.

#+transclude: [[file:keytable_summary.org::Visual]] :only-contents

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package goggles
    :tags '("VISUAL")

  (use-package scrollkeeper
    :elpaca (scrollkeeper :type git :host github :repo "alphapapa/scrollkeeper.el")
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :bind (
      <<keybindings-gen(table=scrollkeeper-remap-keybindings)>>
    ))

  (use-package xhair
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    )
#+end_src

*** DONE Filling
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 12:36]
To be consistent, I prefer to wrap the line at the ~fill-column~ value.
This is functionality is provided by =visual-fill-column=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package visual-fill-column
    :elpaca nil
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    )
#+END_SRC

*** DONE Indentation
CLOSED: [2021-03-01 Mon 09:17]
When I am programming, I like seeing clearly at which indentation level I am.
To see this, I am using =highlight-indent-guides=.
Its configuration is pretty standard except I prefer the ~column~ method to the ~fill~ one.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package highlight-indent-guides
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :hook
    (prog-mode . highlight-indent-guides-mode)
    :config
    (setq highlight-indent-guides-method 'column))
#+end_src

*** DONE Diff
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 12:34]
Due to the amount of modifications, I like having indicators which are reminding me what has been changed.
I am using =diff-hl= which provides a diff. status on the (left for me) fringe.
Long lines are also distracting, so I prefer to ellipse them.
To do so, I use =abridge-diff=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package diff-hl
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :hook ((elpaca-after-init . global-diff-hl-mode)
           (dired-mode . diff-hl-dired-mode-unless-remote))

    :init (setq diff-hl-draw-borders t)
    :config

    ;; Highlight on-the-fly
    (diff-hl-flydiff-mode 1)

    ;; Integration with magit
    (with-eval-after-load 'magit
      (add-hook 'magit-post-refresh-hook #'diff-hl-magit-post-refresh)))

  (use-package abridge-diff
    :after magit ;; optional, if you'd like to use with magit
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :init (abridge-diff-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** DONE Emoji
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 12:28]
I am chatting, mailing and so on.
I prefer to visualize nicely emojis than the raw text.
To do so, I use the package =emojify= which provides everything needed for this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emojify
    :elpaca nil ;; FIXME: temporary way because of stupid slack enforcement
    :tags '("VISUAL" "DESKTOP")
    :functions (emojify-set-emoji-data)
    :custom
    (slack-buffer-emojify               t)
    :hook
    (sauron-mode . emojify-mode)
    (telega-root-mode . (lambda () (emojify-mode 1)))
    (circe-channel-mode . emojify-mode)

    :config
    (when (featurep 'emojify)
      (emojify-set-emoji-data)))

* Key bindings [100%]
In this section, we define the bindings used globally.
We can consider the following categories:
  - The functional bindings :: which allows the user to access to a functionality from anywhere (e.g. opening the version-control manager)
  - The remapped bindings :: which are homogeneizing or extending existing bindings in multiple modes

An helper to remind these bindings is also provided.

** DONE Functional bindings [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:03]
This section defines the functional bindings.
Hydra is used as the provider for these bindings.
For now, we consider the following ones: ~main helpers~, ~version control~ and some ~toggling~

*** DONE Main Helper
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:46]
The main helper, mapped to *<f1>* contains the global operations which are interesting to access globally:
 - org-mode capturing and sniffing webpage
 - zooming
 - bookmarking and listing the bookmarks
 - Mail management: listing the synchronization process managed by *prodigy* and creating a new may

*** DONE Project/Version control
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:46]
The following functional binding is the entry point to deal with code project management.
It is mapped to *<f4>*
It deals with:
  - project management using *projectile*
  - version control using *magit*
  - fixme
  - flychecks
  - travis

This section configures an access to a bunch of minor modes (or other) which can be toggled.
It is a copy paste of what is proposed in the README file of the [[https://github.com/jerrypnz/major-mode-hydra.el][major-mode-hydra.el repository]].

** DONE Remapped bindings [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:01]
The following bindings are remapped to be homogeneous accross the different modes and OS.
It concerns mainly the bindings to comment/uncomment and some macos related issues.

*** DONE Commenting
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:50]
I prefer to use a _C-c C-c_ to compile and therefore, the bindings to comment a section of the code should be remapped.
I select _C-c C-;_ to comment and _C-c C-:_ to uncomment.
Adding a toggle support for the commenting would be a good idea too

** DONE Reminder for bindings
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:49]
Finally, because of the amount of keys, I sometimes need a reminder of what is what.
To do so, I am using =remind-bindings=.
