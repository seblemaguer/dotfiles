This is my emacs configuration file. It is under version control and available, among other
configurations, at this repository: https://github.com/seblemaguer/dotfiles

* Server
Before anything happens, we start the server to avoid conflict if there is a problem during the
loading phase.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (server-start)
#+end_src

We also provide a helper to shutdown properly the server.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun server-shutdown ()
  "Save buffers, Quit, and Shutdown (kill) server"
  (interactive)
  (save-some-buffers)
  (kill-emacs))
#+end_src

* Core [100%]
This section focuses on providing helpers and utilities required for the rest of the configuration.

** DONE Fundamentals [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:46]
This section define the fundamental variables and helpers which are recurrently used in the configuration.

*** DONE Define some important variables
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:39]
The section defines the variables =default-plugin-dir= and set the =custom-file=.
Some default values related to emacs' core behaviour, like the garbage collector, are also set here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Define root directory and add the plugins
  (defvar default-plugin-dir (format "%s/plugins" user-emacs-directory)
    "The plugins directory")

  ;; Don't screw up my files with custom
  (setq custom-file (format "%s/custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
  (load custom-file 'noerror)

  ;; Silence!!!!!!
  (setq save-abbrevs 'silently
        ad-redefinition-action 'accept

        ;; Garbage collection (see https://github.com/jethrokuan/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.org)
        gc-cons-threshold 100000000
        large-file-warning-threshold 100000000)
#+end_src

*** DONE Identification helper
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:41]
In order to keep the authentification as private as possible, two primitives are defined here;
one to get the user (=my:auth-source-get-user=) and on to get the password (=my:auth-source-get-passwd=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'cl-lib)
  (cl-defun my:auth-source-get-user (&rest spec &allow-other-keys)
    "Helper to get the user given the SPEC from authsource."
    (let ((founds (apply 'auth-source-search spec)))
      (when founds
	(plist-get (nth 0 founds) :user))))

  (cl-defun my:auth-source-get-passwd (&rest spec &allow-other-keys)
    "Helper to get the password given the SPEC from authsource."
    (let ((founds (apply 'auth-source-search spec)))
      (when founds
	(funcall (plist-get (nth 0 founds) :secret)))))

:PROPERTIES:

:END:
This section defines two functions:
one to generate the emacs init file from =~/.emacs.d/main.org= and one to byte-compile the emacs init file.


#+begin_src emacs-lisp

      ;; Recompile init file
      (byte-compile-disable-warning  'make-local) ;; NOTE: apparently people says this warning is simply wrong, so ignore it!
      (byte-recompile-file (format "%s/init.el" user-emacs-directory) t 0 nil)))

** DONE Package management [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:04]
My configuration relies on a lot (too-many?) of packages.
It relies primarly on =use-package= and some extensions.
The process of how to deal with the packages is the following:
  - by default, if possible, let's use =melpa=
  - if the package is not on melpa, let's use =straight=
  - if the package is on melpa but requires extra development, let's use =straight=

Furthermore, each package is tagged with several keywors to have a "machine-dependent" loading scheme.

*** DONE Emacs package configuration
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:51]
In this section, we are configuring the repositories and emacs internal package management. The only
specificity here is that the TLS algorithm is specific for 26.2.1.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)

  (when (and (= emacs-major-version 26)
             (= emacs-minor-version 2)
             (= emacs-build-number 1))
    (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority "NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3"))

  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil
        package-check-signature nil
        package-archives '(("GNU ELPA"     . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                           ("MELPA"        . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                           ("ORGMODE"      . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/"))

        package-check-signature nil)

  (package-initialize)
#+end_src

*** DONE Load use-package
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:51]
In this section, we are initializing =use-package= in the classic way.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  (eval-when-compile
    (require 'use-package))
  (setq use-package-verbose t)
#+end_src

*** DONE Straight
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:52]
In this section, we are configuring =straight=.
=Straight= supports =use-package= by default.
Therefore, there is no extra-configuration for this to do.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (defvar bootstrap-version)
   (let ((bootstrap-file
          (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))

     (setq straight-vc-git-default-protocol 'ssh))
 #+end_src
 
*** DONE Tagging
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:58]
I am using keywords/tags to define a loading scheme for each of the machine where emacs is installed.
Each package, from now on, has one or multiple keywords associated using the key =:tags=.
Each computer has a series of tags which are required to be loaded.
The specification respects the following syntax:
  - list of strings which are
  - a tag prefixed by =!= explicitely reject packages whose have this tag associated with
  - ="ALL"= is a joker indicating =all the tags!= $\rightarrow$ no filtering


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package use-package-tags
    :straight (use-package-tags :type git :host github :repo "seblemaguer/use-package-tags")
    :config

#+end_src

*** DONE Hydra
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:01]
I use hydra a lot so it is easier to add its support directly in the use-package configuration part.
The combination pretty-hydra/major-mode-hydra provides an easy and powerful way to declare hydra.
While alternatives exist, I find this combination more straightforward and cleaner when it is used in combination with =use-package=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pretty-hydra
    :ensure t
    :tags '("CORE")
    :preface
    (defun with-alltheicon (icon str &optional height v-adjust)
      "Displays an icon from all-the-icon."
      (s-concat (all-the-icons-alltheicon icon :v-adjust (or v-adjust 0) :height (or height 1)) " " str))

    (defun with-faicon (icon str &optional height v-adjust)
      "Displays an icon from Font Awesome icon."
      (s-concat (all-the-icons-faicon icon :v-adjust (or v-adjust 0) :height (or height 1)) " " str))

    (defun with-fileicon (icon str &optional height v-adjust)
      "Displays an icon from the Atom File Icons package."
      (s-concat (all-the-icons-fileicon icon :v-adjust (or v-adjust 0) :height (or height 1)) " " str))

    (defun with-octicon (icon str &optional height v-adjust)
      "Displays an icon from the GitHub Octicons."
      (s-concat (all-the-icons-octicon icon :v-adjust (or v-adjust 0) :height (or height 1)) " " str)))

*** DONE Paradox to enhance package list management
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:04]
The default =list-packages= provides a nice experience.
Nonetheless, a key feature is missing: which are the new packages available after refresh.
=Paradox= is providing this information so I am using it for now even if I prefer the rendering of the default package listing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package paradox
    :ensure t
    :tags '("CORE")
    :commands (paradox-upgrade-packages paradox-list-packages)
    :custom (paradox-automatically-star t)
    :config
    (setq paradox-execute-asynchronously t
          paradox-github-token (my:auth-source-get-passwd :host "api.github.com" :user "seblemaguer^paradox")))
#+end_src

** DONE Load private part
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:11]
Some parts can't be totally hidden using the =my:auth-source-get-*= helpers.
These sensitive configuration parts are store in a dedicated file (identified by the variable =privade-file=) which is loaded here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar private-file "~/.emacs.d/private-variables.el"
    "Path to the file which stores my configuration.")

  (when (file-exists-p private-file)
    (load private-file))
#+end_src

** DONE Notifications [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:14]
Emacs is my entry point for almost everything.
Therefore, it is also useful to have the notifications handled directly in Emacs.
To do so, I rely on the couple sauron/alert.
Alert is the entry point for raising notifications while sauron is used to log the notifications.

This combination allows me to use the modeline as an indicator of the priority of the notification.
By doing so, I can be aware of a notification but choose to ignore it if I am focusing on something else.
If another notification of at most the same priority is raised, it will be logged but there won't be any visible cue.
However, if a notification of an higher priority is raised, the color of the modeline will be updated to reflect the priority of the notification.

*** DONE Sauron
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:13]
Sauron is the pivot of the notification system.
However, I need to use my own fork for two reasons:
the upstream has some priority issues with ERC; I would like to ignore some events emitted by the *org-agenda*.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sauron
    :straight (sauron :type git :host github :repo "djcb/sauron"
                      :fork (:host github
                                   :repo "seblemaguer/sauron"
                                   :branch "functional"))
    :tags '("CORE" "NOTIFICATION")
    :commands (sauron-start-hidden)

    :config
    (defun sauron-keep-priority (msg props)
      "Function to define which event should keep the same priority
    and not be raised even if it is recent. The criterion is based on
    MSG and PROPS."
      (or
       (string= (plist-get props :sender) "root")
       (string= (plist-get props :event) "join")
       (string= (plist-get props :event) "quit")))

    (setq sauron-separate-frame nil ;; The notification is on the same window ?

*** DONE Sauron/Alert/Modeline integration
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:14]
By using my plugin =sauron-mode-line=, I link Alert and Sauron.
By this way, all the Alert notifications are automatically transmitted to Sauron.
If a Sauron event is raised, it is transmitted to Alert to adapt the modeline bar.
This plugin is in charge to managing the communication and avoid any cycle.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sauron-mode-line
    :tags '("CORE" "NOTIFICATION")
    :load-path default-plugin-dir
    :custom

** DONE Documentation [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:19]
Emacs is dense and provides a lot of features.
Too many to remember everything.
This part is there to help to navigate the documentation more easily.

*** DONE Key bindinds
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:18]
=helm-descbinds= is a useful package which provides a way to list all the shortcuts available in the current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** DONE Helpful
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:19]
=helpful= is a powerful package to access to the documentation of a key/symbol/...
It also supports references and back-references.
I am using it as the entry point of any documentation I want to access.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package helpful
    :ensure t
    :tags '("CORE" "DOCUMENTATION")
    :commands (helpful-key helpful-symbol helpful-at-point)
    :bind (("C-h k" . helpful-key)

#+end_src

** DONE Buffer listing
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:24]
Buffer listing is the fundamental navigation tool.
After playing with =ibuffer= and other helpers, I settled using =bufler=.
This choice has been made due its the simplicity and its recursive nature.
=bufler= can be used in conjunction with =prism=.
While this latter package is to define some visual aspect, I only use it in conjunction with =bufler=.
Therefore, I decided to set it up here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; I need prism to use my configuration of bufler

Large files are difficult to handle properly in emacs.
The best way is to use =vlf=.
However, the entry point is actually =vlf-setup=.
This leads to ensuring the package =vlf= with the use-package header defined to be =vlf-setup=

The backups are stored on the cloud so it requires a connection and can't be used on a server.
Finally, instead of having the scratch buffer using the =emacs-lisp-mode= as the major mode, I am using =org-mode= which is less limited.

* Key bindings [0%]
In this section, we define the bindings used globally.
We can consider the following categories:
  - The functional bindings :: which allows the user to access to a functionality from anywhere (e.g. opening the version-control manager)
  - The remapped bindings :: which are homogeneizing or extending existing bindings in multiple modes

An helper to remind these bindings is also provided.

** TODO Functional bindings [0%]
This section defines the functional bindings.
Hydra is used as the provider for these bindings.
For now, we consider the following two ones: *main helpers* and *version control*

*** TODO Main Helper
The main helper, mapped to *<f1>* contains the global operations which are interesting to access globally:
 - org-mode capturing and sniffing webpage
 - zooming
 - bookmarking and listing the bookmarks
 - Mail management: listing the synchronization process managed by *prodigy* and creating a new may

*** TODO Project/Version control
The following functional binding is the entry point to deal with code project management.
It is mapped to *<f4>*
It deals with:
  - project management using *projectile*
  - version control using *magit*
  - fixme
  - flychecks
  - travis

*** TODO Commenting
I prefer to use a _C-c C-c_ to compile and therefore, the bindings to comment a section of the code should be remapped.
I select _C-c C-;_ to comment and _C-c C-:_ to uncomment.
Adding a toggle support for the commenting would be a good idea too
