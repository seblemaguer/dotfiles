This is my emacs configuration file. It is under version control and available, among other
configurations, at this repository: https://github.com/seblemaguer/dotfiles

* Server
Before anything happens, we start the server to avoid conflict if there is a problem during the
loading phase.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (server-start)
#+end_src

We also provide a helper to shutdown properly the server.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun server-shutdown ()
  "Save buffers, Quit, and Shutdown (kill) server"
  (interactive)
  (save-some-buffers)
  (kill-emacs))
#+end_src

* Core [100%]
This section focuses on providing helpers and utilities required for the rest of the configuration.

** DONE Fundamentals [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:46]
This section define the fundamental variables and helpers which are recurrently used in the configuration.

*** DONE Define some important variables
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:39]
The section defines the variables =default-plugin-dir= and set the =custom-file=.
Some default values related to emacs' core behaviour, like the garbage collector, are also set here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Define cloud variables
  (defvar cloud-emacs-root-dir "~/pCloudDrive/emacs"
    "The root directory of emacs specific files which should be saved on the cloud.")

  (defvar cloud-org-root-dir "~/pCloudDrive/org"
    "The root directory of org-mode specific files which should be saved on the cloud.")

  ;; Define root directory and add the plugins
  (defvar default-plugin-dir (format "%s/plugins" user-emacs-directory)
    "The plugins directory")

  ;; Don't screw up my files with custom
  (setq custom-file (format "%s/custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
  (load custom-file 'noerror)

  ;; Silence!!!!!!
  (setq save-abbrevs 'silently
        ad-redefinition-action 'accept

        ;; Garbage collection (see https://github.com/jethrokuan/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.org)
        gc-cons-threshold 100000000
        large-file-warning-threshold 100000000)
#+end_src

*** DONE Identification helper
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:41]
In order to keep the authentification as private as possible, two primitives are defined here;
one to get the user (=my:auth-source-get-user=) and on to get the password (=my:auth-source-get-passwd=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'cl-lib)
  (require 'auth-source)
  (cl-defun my:auth-source-get-user (&rest spec &allow-other-keys)
    "Helper to get the user given the SPEC from authsource."
    (let ((founds (apply 'auth-source-search spec)))
      (when founds
	(plist-get (nth 0 founds) :user))))

  (cl-defun my:auth-source-get-passwd (&rest spec &allow-other-keys)
    "Helper to get the password given the SPEC from authsource."
    (let ((founds (apply 'auth-source-search spec)))
      (when founds
	(funcall (plist-get (nth 0 founds) :secret)))))

*** DONE Dealing with tangling this file

:PROPERTIES:
:FROM:     https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6t37yg/org_mode_dot_emacs/
:END:
This section defines two functions:
one to generate the emacs init file from =~/.emacs.d/main.org= and one to byte-compile the emacs init file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun tangle-main-org ()
    "Tangle ~/.emacs.d/main.org to ~/.emacs.d/init.el."
    (interactive)

    ;; Tangle to init.el
    (with-current-buffer (find-file (concat user-emacs-directory "main.org"))
      (org-babel-tangle))

    ;; byte-compile plugins
    (byte-recompile-directory (expand-file-name default-plugin-dir) 0))

  (defun compile-init ()
    "Byte compiles ~/.emacs.d/init.el."
    (interactive)
    (when (equal (buffer-name)
                 (concat "main.org"))
      ;; Recompile init file
      (byte-compile-disable-warning  'make-local) ;; NOTE: apparently people says this warning is simply wrong, so ignore it!
      (byte-recompile-file (format "%s/init.el" user-emacs-directory) t 0 nil)))
#+end_src

** DONE Package management [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:04]
My configuration relies on a lot (too-many?) of packages.
It relies primarly on =use-package= and some extensions.
The process of how to deal with the packages is the following:
  - by default, if possible, let's use =melpa=
  - if the package is not on melpa, let's use =straight=
  - if the package is on melpa but requires extra development, let's use =straight=

Furthermore, each package is tagged with several keywors to have a "machine-dependent" loading scheme.

*** DONE Straight
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:52]
In this section, we are configuring =straight=.
=Straight= supports =use-package= by default.
Therefore, there is no extra-configuration for this to do.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (defvar bootstrap-version)
   (let ((bootstrap-file
          (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
         (bootstrap-version 5))
     (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
       (with-current-buffer
           (url-retrieve-synchronously
            "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
            'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
         (goto-char (point-max))
         (eval-print-last-sexp)))
     (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))

   (unless (string= (getenv "TRAVIS") "true")
     (setq straight-vc-git-default-protocol 'ssh))
 #+end_src

*** DONE Load use-package
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:51]
Now that straight is configured, we can tell it to install =use-package=.
From there, =use-package= will be used as the entry function to configure a new package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (straight-use-package 'use-package)
  (setq straight-use-package-by-default t)
  ;; (setq use-package-verbose t)
#+end_src

*** DONE Tagging
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 10:58]
I am using keywords/tags to define a loading scheme for each of the machine where emacs is installed.
Each package, from now on, has one or multiple keywords associated using the key =:tags=.
Each computer has a series of tags which are required to be loaded.
The specification respects the following syntax:
  - list of strings which are
  - a tag prefixed by =!= explicitely reject packages whose have this tag associated with
  - ="ALL"= is a joker indicating =all the tags!= $\rightarrow$ no filtering

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package use-package-tags
    :straight (use-package-tags :type git :host github :repo "seblemaguer/use-package-tags")
    :config
    (setq use-package-tags-enabled
          `(("lemagues-surface" . ("ALL" "!MUSIC"))
            ("sig201"           . ("ALL"))
            ("mackenzie"        . ("!MAIL" "!RSS" "!USER" "!GUI" "!MULTIMEDIA" "!CHAT" "!DESKTOP"))
            (,use-package-tags-default-host . ("CORE" "!USER" "!DESKTOP")))))
#+end_src

*** DONE Hydra
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:01]
I use hydra a lot so it is easier to add its support directly in the use-package configuration part.
The combination pretty-hydra/major-mode-hydra provides an easy and powerful way to declare hydra.
While alternatives exist, I find this combination more straightforward and cleaner when it is used in combination with =use-package=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pretty-hydra
    :tags '("CORE")
    :preface
    (defun with-alltheicon (icon str &optional height v-adjust)
      "Displays an icon from all-the-icon."
      (s-concat (all-the-icons-alltheicon icon :v-adjust (or v-adjust 0) :height (or height 1)) " " str))

    (defun with-faicon (icon str &optional height v-adjust)
      "Displays an icon from Font Awesome icon."
      (s-concat (all-the-icons-faicon icon :v-adjust (or v-adjust 0) :height (or height 1)) " " str))

    (defun with-fileicon (icon str &optional height v-adjust)
      "Displays an icon from the Atom File Icons package."
      (s-concat (all-the-icons-fileicon icon :v-adjust (or v-adjust 0) :height (or height 1)) " " str))

    (defun with-octicon (icon str &optional height v-adjust)
      "Displays an icon from the GitHub Octicons."
      (s-concat (all-the-icons-octicon icon :v-adjust (or v-adjust 0) :height (or height 1)) " " str)))

  (use-package major-mode-hydra
    :demand t
    :tags '("CORE")
    :bind
    ("M-SPC" . major-mode-hydra))
#+end_src

** DONE Load private part
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:11]
Some parts can't be totally hidden using the =my:auth-source-get-*= helpers.
These sensitive configuration parts are store in a dedicated file (identified by the variable =privade-file=) which is loaded here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar private-file (concat user-emacs-directory "private-variables.el")
    "Path to the file which stores my configuration.")

  (when (file-exists-p private-file)
    (load private-file))
#+end_src

** DONE Notifications [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:14]
Emacs is my entry point for almost everything.
Therefore, it is also useful to have the notifications handled directly in Emacs.
To do so, I rely on the couple sauron/alert.
Alert is the entry point for raising notifications while sauron is used to log the notifications.

This combination allows me to use the modeline as an indicator of the priority of the notification.
By doing so, I can be aware of a notification but choose to ignore it if I am focusing on something else.
If another notification of at most the same priority is raised, it will be logged but there won't be any visible cue.
However, if a notification of an higher priority is raised, the color of the modeline will be updated to reflect the priority of the notification.

*** DONE Sauron
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:13]
Sauron is the pivot of the notification system.
However, I need to use my own fork for two reasons:
the upstream has some priority issues with ERC; I would like to ignore some events emitted by the *org-agenda*.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sauron
    :straight (sauron :type git :host github :repo "djcb/sauron"
                      :fork (:host github
                                   :repo "seblemaguer/sauron"
                                   :branch "functional"))
    :tags '("CORE" "NOTIFICATION")
    :commands (sauron-start-hidden)

    :config
    (defun sauron-keep-priority (msg props)
      "Function to define which event should keep the same priority
    and not be raised even if it is recent. The criterion is based on
    MSG and PROPS."
      (or
       (string= (plist-get props :sender) "root")
       (string= (plist-get props :event) "join")
       (string= (plist-get props :event) "quit")))

    (setq sauron-separate-frame nil ;; The notification is on the same window ?
          sauron-sticky-frame t
          sauron-max-line-length nil ;; No max. length for the line
          sauron-modules '(sauron-org) ;; reduced the default modules
          sauron-column-alist '(( timestamp  .  20)
                                ( origin     .  20)
                                ( priority   .   4)
                                ( message    . nil))
          sauron-org-exclude-todo-states (list "IN PROCESS" "EXEC_STARTED" "PAUSED" "DELEGATED" "WAITING")
          sauron-insensitivity-handler 'sauron-keep-priority)
  )
#+end_src

*** DONE Sauron/Alert/Modeline integration
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:14]
By using my plugin =sauron-mode-line=, I link Alert and Sauron.
By this way, all the Alert notifications are automatically transmitted to Sauron.
If a Sauron event is raised, it is transmitted to Alert to adapt the modeline bar.
This plugin is in charge to managing the communication and avoid any cycle.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sauron-mode-line
    :straight nil
    :load-path default-plugin-dir
    :tags '("CORE" "NOTIFICATION")
    :custom
    (sauron-event-added-functions 'sauron-mode-line-notifier-from-sauron)

    :commands (sauron-mode-line-start-hidden)
    :hook (after-init . sauron-mode-line-start-hidden)

    (("<f7>"   . sauron-mode-line-toggle-hide-show)
     ("C-<f7>" . sauron-mode-line-clear)))
#+end_src

** DONE Documentation [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:19]
Emacs is dense and provides a lot of features.
Too many to remember everything.
This part is there to help to navigate the documentation more easily.

*** DONE Key bindinds
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:18]
=helm-descbinds= is a useful package which provides a way to list all the shortcuts available in the current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm-descbinds
    :tags '("CORE" "DOCUMENTATION")
    :commands (helm-descbinds)
    :bind
    ("C-h b" . helm-descbinds))
#+end_src

*** DONE Helpful
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:19]
=helpful= is a powerful package to access to the documentation of a key/symbol/...
It also supports references and back-references.
I am using it as the entry point of any documentation I want to access.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package helpful
    :tags '("CORE" "DOCUMENTATION")
    :commands (helpful-key helpful-symbol helpful-at-point)
    :bind (("C-h k" . helpful-key)
           ("C-h a" . helpful-symbol)
           ("C-h h" . helpful-at-point)))
#+end_src

*** DONE Man
CLOSED: [2021-03-01 Mon 09:28]
Man is critical for document on unix.
I simply configured emacs to add my own environment man directories.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package man
    :tags '("CORE" "DOCUMENTATION")
    :config
    (setq Man-notify-method 'pushy

** DONE Buffer listing
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:24]
Buffer listing is the fundamental navigation tool.
After playing with =ibuffer= and other helpers, I settled using =bufler=.
This choice has been made due its the simplicity and its recursive nature.
=bufler= is used in conjunction with =prism= is assumed to be loaded later.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package bufler

** DONE Large files
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:28]
Large files are difficult to handle properly in emacs.
The best way is to use =vlf=.
However, the entry point is actually =vlf-setup=.
This leads to ensuring the package =vlf= with the use-package header defined to be =vlf-setup=

* Session [100%]
As I am using emacs as a daemon/client combination,
my daily routine consists of opening emacs at the beginning of work and switching it off on the evening.
Therefore it is difficult to track what needs to be remembered.

** DONE Backup files [100%]

This section is dedicated to deal with backups. The main logic is to exlude some specific files

other ones, I want to have an easy way to navigate in it.

:PROPERTIES:
:FROM:     https://github.com/munen/emacs.d
:END:
When a file is large, it is easier to restart from the exact position where we stopped.
To do so, I am using the package =saveplace=

** DONE Scratch
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 11:39]
I am using the scratch buffer as a notebook.
Therefore, as everything which is not saved elsewhere is saved there, I am using =scratch-ext= to deal with the saving/loading part.
The backups are stored on the cloud so it requires a connection and can't be used on a server.
Finally, instead of having the scratch buffer using the =emacs-lisp-mode= as the major mode, I am using =org-mode= which is less limited.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package scratch-ext
    :tags '("CORE" "SESSION" "CONNECTED")

#+end_src

* Org-mode [100%]
=Org-mode= is the core of how I am organizing tasks, writing documents, ...
While it is mainly a programming/writing language, it involves too many subparts and, therefore, has its own section.

** DONE Global
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 12:42]
This section defines the global configuration for =org-mode=.
First, it actually relies on =org-plus-contrib=, especially for the bibtex support.
Then, it defines the fundamentals of the GTD pipeline by adding some TODO keywords:
  - =CANCELLED= and =POSTPONED= for task which can't be done for whatever reason;
  - =WAITING= for tasks which are blocked by an external event;
  - =PAUSED= for tasks which are manually put to sleep for whatever reason;
  - =EXEC_STARTED= for tasks which are running but doesn't requires any manual operation (i.e. process on the cluster)
  - =DELEGATED= for tasks which are delegated to someone else

Some additional keywords are also defined to deal with more specific events:
  - =RELEASE= points to an album to be released
  - =MAIL= points to an email to be replied to
  - =REVIEW= points to an article, ... to review

Finally, some keywords are there for note purposes:
  - =NOTE= points to a note to be saved
  - =EVENT= points to an event to happen
  - =MANDATORY= points to an event which I have to do but it is recurrent!

The key problem in my opinion is how are visualize the headings.
=org-superstar= provides a clearer indentation and visualisation of such headings.
This is fundamental to have an easy navigation in such files which can be really large (see the current one!).

In order to have a better editing environment, I configured several fundamental features: undoing, folding, completing and templating.

** DONE Undoing
CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 08:57]
For undoing an operation, I am using =undo-tree=.
The only configuration here is to activate it globally.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package undo-tree
    :tags '("UNDOING")
    :init
    (global-undo-tree-mode))
#+end_src

** DONE Folding
CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 09:00]
For the folding, I am relying by default on the builtin minor mode =outline=.
I prefer the org look-and-feel so I use =outshine= on top of outline.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package outshine
    :straight (outshine :type git :host github :repo "alphapapa/outshine")
    :tags '("FOLDING")
    :commands (outshine-cycle)
    :bind
    (:map outline-minor-mode-map
          ("<C-tab>"  . outshine-cycle)))
#+end_src

** DONE Completing [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:52]
Completion is one of the biggest time-saver feature a text editor can have.
I rely on three key completion systems for different purposes:
  - =company= is used for inline completion (mainly to access programming helpers and snippets)
  - =selectrum= is used as the standard mini-buffer based completion
  - =helm= is provided for some specific completion tools which are interesting but are not supported by =selectrum=

*** DONE Company
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:42]
In this section, only the global configuration of =company= is provided.
The configuration associated with each language is done separately and is, as much as possible, buffer local.
I also use =company-quickhelp= to provide the description of the current candidate.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :tags '("COMPLETION")
    :init
    (setq company-backends '(company-capf company-files))

    :config
    ;; Global
    (setq company-idle-delay 1
          company-minimum-prefix-length 1
          company-show-numbers t
          company-tooltip-limit 20)

    ;; Activating globally
    (global-company-mode t))

  (use-package company-quickhelp
    :after company
    :tags '("COMPLETION" "UI")
    :config
    (company-quickhelp-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** DONE Selectrum
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:42]
This section provides the configuration of =selectrum=.
Nothing fancy happens here, just its activation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package selectrum
    :tags '("COMPLETION")
    :config
    (selectrum-mode +1))

#+end_src
*** DONE Helm
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:43]
I use Helm for some specific cases which requires an important visibility space completion.
Once again, nothing fancy here, the configuration to have a better UX.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm
    :tags '("COMPLETION")
    :functions helm-show-completion-default-display-function
    :config
    (setq helm-scroll-amount 4 ; scroll 4 lines other window using M-<next>/M-<prior>
          helm-quick-update t ; do not display invisible candidates
          helm-idle-delay 0.01 ; be idle for this many seconds, before updating in delayed sources.
          helm-input-idle-delay 0.01 ; be idle for this many seconds, before updating candidate buffer
          helm-show-completion-display-function #'helm-show-completion-default-display-function
          helm-split-window-default-side 'below ;; open helm buffer in another window
          helm-split-window-inside-p t ;; open helm buffer inside current window, not occupy whole other window
          helm-candidate-number-limit 200 ; limit the number of displayed canidates
          helm-move-to-line-cycle-in-source nil ; move to end or beginning of source when reaching top or bottom of source.
          )
    )
#+end_src
*** DONE Extension [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:52]
While the previous completion system is enough to work on its own, it is possible to enhance the user experince by adding a couple of more tweaks.

**** DONE Prescient
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:44]
Prescient helps to sort candidates by last used first and then sorting by length.
It integrates well with selectrum and company but doesn't support helm (yet?!).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package prescient
    :tags '("COMPLETION")
    :config
    (prescient-persist-mode +1))

  (use-package selectrum-prescient
    :tags '("COMPLETION")
    :config (selectrum-prescient-mode +1))

  (use-package company-prescient
    :tags '("COMPLETION")
    :config (company-prescient-mode +1))
#+end_src

**** DONE Marginalia
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:49]
Marginalia is completing =selectrum= by providing annotations to the candidates.
For now, I am using the default configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package marginalia
    :bind (:map minibuffer-local-map
                ("C-M-a" . marginalia-cycle)
           ;; When using the Embark package, you can bind `marginalia-cycle' as an Embark action!
           ;;:map embark-general-map
           ;;     ("A" . marginalia-cycle)
          )

    ;; The :init configuration is always executed (Not lazy!)
    :init

    ;; Must be in the :init section of use-package such that the mode gets
    ;; enabled right away. Note that this forces loading the package.
    (marginalia-mode)

    ;; When using Selectrum, ensure that Selectrum is refreshed when cycling annotations.
    (advice-add #'marginalia-cycle :after
                (lambda () (when (bound-and-true-p selectrum-mode) (selectrum-exhibit))))

    ;; Prefer richer, more heavy, annotations over the lighter default variant.
    ;; E.g. M-x will show the documentation string additional to the keybinding.
    ;; By default only the keybinding is shown as annotation.
    ;; Note that there is the command `marginalia-cycle' to
    ;; switch between the annotators.
    (setq marginalia-annotators '(marginalia-annotators-heavy marginalia-annotators-light nil)))
#+end_src

**** DONE Consult
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:52]
Consult provides a set of commands which are particularly useful.
It is a nice extension to =selectrum= which brings to functionalities close to the ones proposed in =swiper= and =counsel=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package consult
    :bind (("C-x M-:"  . consult-complex-command)
           ("C-c h"    . consult-history)

           ("C-x b"    . consult-buffer)
           ("C-x 4 b"  . consult-buffer-other-window)
           ("C-x 5 b"  . consult-buffer-other-frame)
           ("C-x r x"  . consult-register)
           ("C-x r b"  . consult-bookmark)
           ("C-x C-r"  . consult-recent-file)
           ("M-g g"    . consult-goto-line)
           ("M-g M-g"  . consult-goto-line)
           ("M-g o"    . consult-outline)     ;; "M-s o" is a good alternative.

           ("M-s m"    . consult-multi-occur)

    ;; The :init configuration is always executed (Not lazy!)
    :init

    ;; Replace `multi-occur' with `consult-multi-occur', which is a drop-in replacement.
    (fset 'multi-occur #'consult-multi-occur)

  (use-package consult-flycheck

#+end_src

** DONE Templating [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:58]
I use templates for two cases:
  - starting point as new script/code file
  - accessing to some snippets.

In both cases, I rely on =yasnippet=.

*** DONE Snippets
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:57]
The default configuration of yasnippet consists of activating it and plugging it with company.
Obviously, the package =yasnippet-snippets= is also configured to provide default snippets.
Finally, my own snippets are stored in the directory =~/.emacs.d/third_parties/snippets=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package yasnippet
    :tags '("COMPLETION")
    :init
    (yas-global-mode 1))

  ;; Load snippets
  (use-package yasnippet-snippets
    :tags '("COMPLETION")
    :config

    ;; Add third parties snippets
    (defvar third-parties-snippet-dir (format "%s/third_parties/snippets" user-emacs-directory)
      "Directory containing my own snippets")

    (defun third-parties-snippets-initialize ()
      (add-to-list 'yas-snippet-dirs 'third-parties-snippet-dir t)
      (yas-load-directory third-parties-snippet-dir t))

    (eval-after-load 'yasnippet '(third-parties-snippets-initialize)))
#+end_src

*** DONE File templates
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 17:58]
This part is using yatemplate (an over-layer of yasnippet) coupled with auto-insert to have a set of
file type dedicated templates. The templates are available in =~/.emacs.d/third_parties/templates= directory.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package yatemplate
    :tags '("COMPLETION")
    :after yasnippet
    :config

    ;; Define template directory
    (setq yatemplate-dir (concat user-emacs-directory "/third_parties/templates"))

* IDE [100%]
While the environment configuration is fundamental for editing,
it is necessary to add more features to simplify coding life.
This section focuses on three components: the compilation, the commenting and the formatting.

** DONE Compilation [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 18:23]
I configured the configuration around two main parts:
refining the default compilation support and add fly-checking support.

*** DONE Baseline compilation
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 18:23]
I just modify a little bit the default compilation to be a little more "user friendly".
This implies two key features:
  - colorizing the compilation buffer for better reading
  - closing the compilation buffer if the compilation was a success.

A bug (described in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15489319/how-can-i-skip-in-file-included-from-in-emacs-c-compilation-mode ) is also addressed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package compile
    :defer

       ("l" (condition-case err
                (while t

    (setcar (nthcdr 5 (assoc 'gcc-include compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist)) 0))
#+end_src

*** DONE Flychecking
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 18:13]
For the fly checking, I use flycheck instead of flymake.
The key part of this configuration is the fact that checking the documentation is disabled.
I also use =flycheck-posframe= to have a quick idea of what is going on at the pointed error/warning/...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Disable checking doc
  (use-package flycheck
    :tags '("CORE" "COMPILATION" "IDE")
    :commands (flycheck-error-list-set-filter flycheck-next-error flycheck-previous-error flycheck-first-error)
    :pretty-hydra
    ((:pre (progn (setq hydra-hint-display-type t) (flycheck-list-errors))

       ("G"  (progn (goto-char (point-max)) (flycheck-previous-error)) "Last")
       ("<"  project-hydra/body "back"))))

    :config
    (setq-default flycheck-disabled-checkers '(emacs-lisp-checkdoc)))

  (use-package flycheck-posframe
    :disabled t
    :tags '("CORE" "UI")
    :after flycheck
    :hook (flycheck-mode . flycheck-posframe-mode)
    :config
    (setq flycheck-posframe-warning-prefix "\u26a0 "))
#+end_src

** DONE Commenting
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 18:33]
For the commenting, the common denominator is how to deal with FIXMEs.
To do so, I relie on two part: fic-mode for the highlighting and occur for the listing.
For language specific configurations, it is done in the language configuration part.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package fic-mode
    :tags '("CORE" "IDE")
    :hook
    (prog-mode . fic-mode)

    :init
    (defun fic-view-listing ()
      "Use occur to list related FIXME keywords"
      (interactive)
      (occur "\\<\\(FIXME\\|WRITEME\\|WRITEME!\\|TODO\\|BUG\\|NOTE\\):?")))
#+end_src

** DONE Formatting
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 18:26]
In order to format the buffer, it is better to rely on external formatter/linter.
=format-all= proposes support of big bunch of them, so I am using it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package format-all
    :tags '("IDE" "FORMAT")
    :commands (format-all-buffer format-all-mode))
#+end_src

** DONE Sanitizing
CLOSED: [2021-01-25 Mon 20:21]
This part contains sanitizing helpers before saving the files.
For now it consists of simply removing any trailing whitespace.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
#+END_SRC

* Programming [100%]
Now that the environment is set, it is time to configure the different part to use emacs as a proper developping environment.
To do so, I rely mainly on Language Server Protocol (LSP).

** DONE LSP general configuration
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 21:28]
The general configuration of LSP is centered around two key parts: the UI and the keys.
I also override some default parameters to make the experience more appealing.

This section is dedicated to the configuration of modes to deal with data formats.

*** DONE CSV

*** DONE CUE
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 21:35]
I use CUE files to guide audio CD I encode.
I developed a dedicated mode for this, so I am using it

*** DONE JSON
CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 21:47]
I am using JSON both for storing data and for configuration.
The configuration relies on =json-mode= for the main part and =json-reformat= for a better formatting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

I use praat, and more especially Textgrid, to annotate speech signals.
Praat-mode helps to have a proper visualization of Textgrids in Empacs.

XML is, as JSON, used for data formatting and configuration.
However, I had to do extra-configurations to have outline support and a better formatting.

CRON is a useful tool to plan some executions.
However the default editor is too raw for me.

Therefore, visualizing logs is key and =log-view= is a really flexible mode for this.
While it is configured to open files whose basenames contain ~syslog~ or the extension is composed by ~.log~.
In both cases, backup numbers are as well supported.

Nonetheless, both sections rely on the same principles.
Concerning the writing part, I use mainly org-mode and LaTeX (article and shared documents).

LaTeX is the core languages I am using to write scientific documents and presentations.
My configuration relies mainly on auctex but I had to tweak several part to match my way of dealing with such files.
These tweaks concerns mainly of using =outline= to deal with folding,
using the ~enquote~ command to do some quotation in latex and prepare a proper pdf compilation/synchronization.

** DONE TikZ/PGF
CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 12:18]
To generate figures, I use sometimes inkscape but main TikZ/PGF.
While ktikz provides a nice tools, the way it deals with the header is problematic for me.
Furthermore, it is not integrated in emacs :D
Therefore, I developed a mode.
However, it relies on a side script ~compilePGF~ being in the PATH!

Markdown is the main language used to write READMEs in collaborative projects.
While I prefer it org-mode, I still have to use it for collaborative purposes.
Consequently, I have to get a proper configuration.
Luckily, =markdown-mode= and =markdown-mode+= provide more than enough.
I just added =grip-mode= to have a proper preview of the file.

* Version Control / Project Management [100%]
My code project management is articulated around three key points: GIT, github/gist and =projectile=.
GIT is used as the version control manager;
github for the non-sensitive repositories;
gist for snippets and helpers;
=projectile= to provide project helpers.

** DONE Git

My configuration for GIT relies mainly on =magit=.
Aside the standard key/hydra configuration,
I copied the external opening from https://gist.github.com/dotemacs/9a0433341e75e01461c9
and the pretty configuration is adapted from https://ekaschalk.github.io/post/pretty-magit/

My whole process relies on the commits following this pattern
#+begin_example
[package] operation: short message

optional further description
#+end_example

where:
 - package :: corresponds to subpart of the repository (so mainly packages, modules, or meta and git related informations).
 - operation :: is ~add~, ~update~, ~fix~, ~clean~ or ~doc~
 - short message :: is a short description
 - optional further description :: is used to complete the short description. It is optional and I don't use it so often; only for complicated tweaks

* Shell [100%]
My use of shell is kind of anarchic.
I alternate between zsh and emacs internal shell (eshell).
Because I use eshell regularly, I spend some time to configure it in details.
The main part of the configuration is coming from https://github.com/jcf/emacs.d.
The rest has been adapted from http://www.modernemacs.com/post/custom-eshell/.

The builtin =eshell= package provides enough information to be used.
Nonetheless, adding some complementary packages helps to have a better UX.
For now, I restrict this to some visualuation helpers (=eshell-fringe-status= & =eshell-syntax-highlighting=) and some completion helpers (=fish-completion=).
I also prefer to toggle the shell as I generally use it for quick commands.
For this, I use the =eshell-toggle= package.

* File manager [100%]
I am using emacs as my main file manager.
To do so, I rely on =dired= which is builtin package which I tweaked massively and I added multiple subpackages to improve UX.
I also added support for basic image processing and some additional operations (trashing, visualising diffs, ...).

** DONE Dired [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 18:55]
The configuration of =dired= focuses mainly on defining keys, tuning the files to omit, and tweaking the LS command used to get the informations.
The hydra mapping is adapted from https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/wiki/Dired.
I also replace a base deletion by moving the files/directories to the trash.

** DONE Treemacs
CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 19:25]
To have a quick visualisation (on the sidebar) of the project directory tree (and a little bit further), I am using treemacs.
Aside tweaking the configuration to fit more my needs, a key part of the configuration is to redefine the function ~treemacs--setup-mode-line~.
This is necessary in order to avoid issues with the modeline I use.
I added support for visualizing the git status (=treemacs-magit=),
for project restriction (=treemacs-projectile=) and adding some icons (=treemacs-icons-dired=).

I am using emacs to deal with a lot of online stuffy.
The main services I consult using emacs are: RSS streams, emails, chats, "exchange services" and CD releases.

** DONE RSS [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 19:53]
To retrieve and visualize my RSS feeds, I use =elfeed=.
As a general configuration, I just changed where elfeed's database is stored to be available on the cloud.
I rely on subpackages (see subsections) to enhance the experience.

** DONE Mail [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:08]
Emacs is my only email client.
It is based around the ecosystem =mu/mu4e= which provides everything we need to deal with emails.
This configuration is articulated around three parts: the authentification part, the composing emails part and the mu4e part.

*** DONE Authentification
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 08:20]
In previous emacs version (< 27), it was necessary to configure the package =starttls=.
This configuration is remaining here for backward compatibility purposes.

*** DONE Composing emails
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 08:27]
To compose emails, I rely on the combination of multiple packages.
Obviously, the entry point is the package =message= whose ~message-mode~ is the major mode used to edit new emails.
I configured the package to support some additional features like a proper signature and a proper formatting.
I also updated the citation line/format.

As I am using multiple account, I use the package =smtpmail-multi= to sort this out.
The default account is my TCD email as it is my daily use email.

Because, sometimes, I want to send rich emails, I use =org-mime= which relies on the HTML exporter provided by =org= to generate HTML emails.
Finally, as I am quite absent-minded, I use a reminder to not forget the attachment: =message-attachment-reminder=.

*** DONE Mu4e [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 08:53]
As I previously indicated, =mu4e= is my entry point to deal with emails.
However, it can't be installed via melpa.
I have a bunch of scripts which are configuring my linux environment on ~~/environment/~.
These scripts are installing ~mu~ and =mu4e= so the first thing to do here is to point the current configuration ~load-path~.

The core of the configuration is separated in four main parts:
the hydra definition, the adaptation of the ~mu4e~ environment, the introduction of new primitives and, finally, the definition of contexts.
The last part is the most important as it provides the configuration for the mail accounts.
These configurations are set in the private configuration file and provided by the function =set-mu4e-contexts=.
The introduced new primitive provides a connection to EAF (~mu4e-eaf-wrapper~; see further for EAF).
I also redesigned the header buffer.

** DONE Chat [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:32]
As for the email, I (try to) use emacs as my chatting entry point as well.
To do so, I rely on three key tools: the couple bitlbee/IRC for facebook messenger, skype, ...; slack and matrix.
I added a bunch of helpers to start/stop all the accounts in one shot.

*** DONE IRC
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:32]
The IRC configuration is quite standard.
I added a couple of primitives to access more easily the passwords (~my-irc-password~) and to format properly the chat buffer (~erc-format-buffer~).
I slightly tweaked the formatting to be more tolerant and added a bunch of plugins to enhance the UX.
Finally, the account definition is done in the private configuration file (so it is not shown here!).

* Music
I am playing music in Emacs using EMMS.
The default configuration is already satisfying but I prefered to tweak a couple of part to make it more useable.
The first thing I changed is to use ~mpv~ as a player as I am already it as a default on my system.
I also tweaked the cache and some rendering part as I have a lot of files to navigate through.
Finally, I activated the browser and assigned the multimedia keys to be understood directly by EMMS.

* Emacs and the rest of the world [100%]
As Emacs is the entry point of my numerical life, I connected to a bunch of other external things.
It can be summarized around three categories:
the connection to the desktop environment,
the connection to the local operating system,
and the connection to servers (mainly computing clusters).

** DONE Emacs and the desktop [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 12:51]
In this section, I configure a set of packages to control different desktop aspect using Emacs.
Each subsection focuses on dedicated aspect of the desktop.

*** DONE Desktop environment control
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 12:41]
=desktop-environment= is package which captures bindings in emacs from multimedia keys (mainly).
I mainly control screen and keyboard brightness using it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package desktop-environment
    :tags '("DESKTOP")
    :config
    (setq desktop-environment-brightness-normal-increment "-inc 10"

          desktop-environment-brightness-small-increment "-inc 5"
          desktop-environment-brightness-small-decrement "-dec 5"
          desktop-environment-brightness-get-command "xbacklight -get"
          desktop-environment-brightness-set-command "xbacklight")
    (desktop-environment-mode))

*** DONE Emacs Application Framework (EAF)
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 12:51]
Emacs Application Framework (EAF) provides a way to integrate multiple applications internally into Emacs.
Emacs needs to be compiled using the flag ~--with-modules~ as it requires some dynamic linking.
In addition, =eaf= is installed externally as it requires additional compilation effort.
As for =mu4e=, my environment scripts are taking care of the compilation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package eaf

** DONE Emacs and the system [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:42]
In a lower level, I want to have a better access to some system/(non desktop-)environment tools.
I separated the configuration into three main subsections:
the section dedicated to the system/shell,
the section dedicated to specific tools,
and the section dedicated to background processes/"daemons" management directly into Emacs.

*** DONE System and Shell
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:13]
In this section, I configure packages to access system informations and enforce the shell environment into Emacs.

**** DONE Get system control information
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:11]
To access the global OS information, =sysctl= provides a basic interface.
No extra configuration is needed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sysctl
    :tags '("SYSTEM")
    :commands (sysctl))
#+end_src

**** DONE Execute with shell environment
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:13]
Because an important part of my environment relies on a properly configured shell (especially for environment variables),
I use =exec-path-from-shell= to force to run a command using the shell environment.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package exec-path-from-shell
    :tags '("SYSTEM")
    :config
    (setq exec-path-from-shell-arguments nil)
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+end_src

*** DONE Tools
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:21]
This section is dedicated to the configuration of specific tools.
For now, it comprises ~Docker~ and ~Conda~.

**** DONE Docker
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:20]
The package =docker= is already configured to provide everything to interact with Docker.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package docker
    :commands (docker)
    :tags '("SYSTEM"))
#+end_src

**** DONE Conda
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:18]
I am using conda to configure different environment for ~Python~ and ~R~.
The package =conda= provides all the necessary XXX to integrate conda into Emacs.
I am using my own scripts to install and configure conda into my environment directory.
Consequently, the configuration consists mainly of defining the path of conda and activating =conda= for different modes:
~python-mode~, ~ess-mode~ and ~eshell-mode~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package conda
    :tags '("SYSTEM" "PYTHON" "R")
    :init
    (setq conda-anaconda-home (expand-file-name "~/environment/local/miniconda3"))

    (defun conda-hook ()
      "Conda activation hook."
      (setq conda-message-on-environment-switch nil)
      (conda-env-autoactivate-mode t))

    :hook
    (python-mode . conda-hook)
    (ess-mode    . conda-hook)

    :config
    ;; If you want interactive shell support, include:
    (conda-env-initialize-interactive-shells)

    ;; If you want eshell support, include:
    (conda-env-initialize-eshell))
#+end_src

*** DONE Dealing with processes
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 13:26]
To deal with background processes, I rely on two packages: =prodigy= and =elcontext=.
=prodigy= is used to run and monitor the processes.
However, =prodigy= doesn't provide a nice way to start processes automatically.
=elcontext= is used to deal with the start.
Yet =elcontext= is still slightly bugged, so I use my own fork right now.
Currently, it is mainly used to start/stop emails but it is likely to be expanded in the future.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** DONE Emacs and the servers

Finally, I access to computing clusters regularly.
The main tools I am using there are ~docker~ and ~slurm~.
As an entry point, as every Emacs use, I use =tramp= to deal with servers using SSH as a backend.
=slurm-mode= doesn't rely on =tramp= and does not proposes remote access by default.
However, a hack was proposed in [[https://github.com/truls/slurm.el/tree/explicit-username][truls]] fork
I prefere to use my own fork as I would like to expand a bit more the rendering.

* Visual [100%]
For the visual part, I rely mainly on =nano-emacs= developed by Nicolas P. Rougier.
It is a simple layout but incredibly clear and precise.
I deviate from it by prefering my emacs (color) theme (=flatfluc-theme=) and I tweaked a bit the layout (see =my-nano-layout=).
Concerning the layout, I needed to add a specific font resolution for my surface.
This is done in the ~config~ part of the package loading.

** DONE Font/Glyphs
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:41]
Because, I tend to prefer glyphs to plain text, I tweaked a bit the font to override some glyphs.
This is especially useful for =magit=, =dired=, ...
To do so, I rely mainly on the ~nerdfonts~ collection.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun set-icon-fonts (CODE-FONT-ALIST)
    "Utility to associate many unicode points with specified fonts."
    (--each CODE-FONT-ALIST
      (-let (((font . codes) it))
        (--each codes
          (set-fontset-font t `(,it . ,it) font)))))

  (defun load-default-fonts ()
    ;; The icons you see are not the correct icons until this is evaluated!

** DONE Helpers [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 12:36]
In order to guide me a little bit more to the information I need,
I introduce a couple of visual helpers.
All of these helpers are configured in this section.

*** DONE Segmenting
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:51]
To segment properly different part of the code, I rely on two key concepts: separators and page breaks
Separators are coming in two ways: unary (like space) and binary (parenthesis style).
For the former, I sometimes activate the builtin =whitespace-mode= but it doesn't require any configuration.
For the latter, I rely on =smartparens= for the editing part and =rainbow-delimiters= to associate a color to each level of parenthesis.
It is to be noted than =smartparens= is much more completing than what I described and I may use some functionalities without knowing it.
Finally, the package =page-break-lines= provides a nice way to visualize a page break (^L) to be easily spotted.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package smartparens
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :config

    ;; Activate smartparens globally
    (smartparens-global-mode t)
    (show-smartparens-global-mode t)

    ;; Activate smartparens in minibuffer
    (add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook #'smartparens-mode)

    ;; Do not pair simple quotes
    (sp-pair "'" nil :actions :rem))

  (use-package rainbow-delimiters
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :hook
    (prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode))

  (use-package page-break-lines
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :diminish page-break-lines-mode
    :config
    (global-page-break-lines-mode t))
#+end_src

*** DONE Navigating
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:46]
Modifying/Navigating can lead to be slightly confused what has just happened.
I added =googles= to briefly flash to indicate what just changed and =scrollkeeper= to see where I am after a massive scrolling operation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package goggles
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :config
    (goggles-mode)
    (setq-default goggles-pulse t))

  (use-package scrollkeeper
    :straight (scrollkeeper :type git :host github :repo "alphapapa/scrollkeeper.el")
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :bind
    (([remap scroll-up-command]   . scrollkeeper-contents-up)
     ([remap scroll-down-command] . scrollkeeper-contents-down)))
#+end_src

*** DONE Filling
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 12:36]
To be consistent, I prefer to wrap the line at the ~fill-column~ value.
This is functionality is provided by =visual-fill-column=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package visual-fill-column
    :tags '("VISUAL"))
#+END_SRC

*** DONE Indentation
CLOSED: [2021-03-01 Mon 09:17]
When I am programming, I like seeing clearly at which indentation level I am.
To see this, I am using =highlight-indent-guides=.
Its configuration is pretty standard except I prefer the ~column~ method to the ~fill~ one.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package highlight-indent-guides
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :hook
    (prog-mode . highlight-indent-guides-mode)
    :config
    (setq highlight-indent-guides-method 'column))
#+end_src

*** DONE Diff
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 12:34]
Due to the amount of modifications, I like having indicators which are reminding me what has been changed.
I am using =diff-hl= which provides a diff. status on the (left for me) fringe.
Long lines are also distracting, so I prefer to ellipse them.
To do so, I use =abridge-diff=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package diff-hl
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :hook ((after-init . global-diff-hl-mode)
           (dired-mode . diff-hl-dired-mode))

    :init (setq diff-hl-draw-borders t)
    :config

    ;; Highlight on-the-fly
    (diff-hl-flydiff-mode 1)

    ;; Integration with magit
    (with-eval-after-load 'magit
      (add-hook 'magit-post-refresh-hook #'diff-hl-magit-post-refresh)))

  (use-package abridge-diff
    :after magit ;; optional, if you'd like to use with magit
    :tags '("VISUAL")
    :init (abridge-diff-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** DONE Emoji
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 12:28]
I am chatting, mailing and so on.
I prefer to visualize nicely emojis than the raw text.
To do so, I use the package =emojify= which provides everything needed for this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emojify
    :tags '("VISUAL" "DESKTOP")
    :functions (emojify-set-emoji-data)
    :hook (erc-mode . emojify-mode)
    :config

    (setq emojify-user-emojis
          `(("(heart)" . (("name" . "Heart")
                          ("image" . ,(concat user-emacs-directory "emojis/emojione-v2.2.6-22/2665.png"))
                          ("style" . "github")))))

    ;; If emojify is already loaded refresh emoji data
    (when (featurep 'emojify)
      (emojify-set-emoji-data)))
#+end_src

* Key bindings [100%]
In this section, we define the bindings used globally.
We can consider the following categories:
  - The functional bindings :: which allows the user to access to a functionality from anywhere (e.g. opening the version-control manager)
  - The remapped bindings :: which are homogeneizing or extending existing bindings in multiple modes

An helper to remind these bindings is also provided.

** DONE Functional bindings [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:03]
This section defines the functional bindings.
Hydra is used as the provider for these bindings.
For now, we consider the following ones: ~main helpers~, ~version control~ and some ~toggling~

*** DONE Main Helper

The main helper, mapped to *<f1>* contains the global operations which are interesting to access globally:
 - org-mode capturing and sniffing webpage
 - zooming
 - bookmarking and listing the bookmarks
 - Mail management: listing the synchronization process managed by *prodigy* and creating a new may

It is mapped to *<f4>*
It deals with:
  - project management using *projectile*
  - version control using *magit*
  - fixme
  - flychecks
  - travis

** DONE Remapped bindings [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:01]
The following bindings are remapped to be homogeneous accross the different modes and OS.
It concerns mainly the bindings to comment/uncomment and some macos related issues.

*** DONE Commenting
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:50]
I prefer to use a _C-c C-c_ to compile and therefore, the bindings to comment a section of the code should be remapped.
I select _C-c C-;_ to comment and _C-c C-:_ to uncomment.
Adding a toggle support for the commenting would be a good idea too

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package cc-mode
    :tags '("CORE" "BINDING")
    :bind
    (;; Global

          ("C-c C-;" .  comment-region)
          ("C-c C-:" .  uncomment-region)))

*** DONE Mac key remapping
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:01]
I don't know if it is still needed, but I keep this here for now.

#+end_src

** DONE Reminder for bindings
CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 09:49]
Finally, because of the amount of keys, I sometimes need a reminder of what is what.
To do so, I am using =remind-bindings=.
